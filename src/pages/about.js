            <p>
              The career of a professional athlete is short-lived, but the
              skills and experiences attained during the journey last you a
              lifetime. I apply the same drive to succeed as a Web Developer
              where I showcase my retentive learning, creative thinking, and
              superb work ethic. I like finding something new everyday that I
              can create with web development. When I am not huddled over my
              laptop finding a missing semi-colon, I enjoy spending time with
              family, watching quality f√∫tbol, and finding a new place to travel
              to.
